# Covid19_Chest_X-ray_Detection

As countries begin to lift Covid-19 related activity restrictions, diagnostic testing remains extremely important to identify people infected with Covid-19 to help guide treatment and prevent the further spread of the disease. Diagnosis and classification using Chest X-ray image is one of the effective methods. Diagnosis of Covid-19 using X-ray image has benefits in terms of time, cost, and accuracy compared to PCR and LTFs. Therefore, we compare the performance of recently advanced deep learning techniques for the classification of Covid-19 cases from non-Covid-19 cases using X-ray image.
